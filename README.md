This is a graphical user interface (GUI) based application where I visualize the hand-cricket game with python tkinter

Hand Cricket is a game in which two players show scores on their respective fingers. If the scores are equal, the batsman is declared out. Else, the score of the batsman is added to the total runs of the batting team.

In this game you can add amount of over. A bowler delivers the ball from his end of the pitch six times to the batsman at the opposite wicket. This group of six deliveries is called an "over".
